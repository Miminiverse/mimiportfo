            Hi, This is Tam. I am currently an international student in the US. 
            I am persuing a career to be a web developer. 
            I am inspired by beautiful and well-functional websites. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I dedicate most of free time in building website with Django backend, and ReactJS frontend
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn't born a programmer, but with persistence and self-discipline, I believe I can make significant contributions in this field.
